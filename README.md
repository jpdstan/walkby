Crowd-sourced grocery shopping and food delivery.

#### Ideas
* Notify those who live within a certain distance of you that you're about to make a purchase at _______
    * Anbang - This should probably be changed to those whose phones' location services place them within the delivery radius
    * i.e. a library or something of the like. 
* Only allow a certain amount of orders, orders from a specific place, orders within a region
* Integrate with Google Maps SDK to have real-time updates of locations
* Integrate with Venmo to ensure payment before delivery
* Integrate with Yelp to show things that are nearby
