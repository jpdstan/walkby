Crowd-sourced grocery shopping and food delivery.
#### Our Philosophy
* To make the lives of college students and others both easier and less expensive by offering a people-powered alternative to delivery services. We do this by offering the names you know and trust, from restaurants to grocery stores, delivered by people just like you right to your door at a lesser charge than you would have paid directly.
#### Ideas
* Notify those who live within a certain distance of you that you're about to make a purchase at _______
    * Anbang - This should probably be changed to those whose phones' location services place them within the delivery radius
    * i.e. a library or something of the like. 
* Only allow a certain amount of orders, orders from a specific place, orders within a region
* Integrate with Google Maps SDK to have real-time updates of locations
* Integrate with Venmo to ensure payment before delivery
* Integrate with Yelp to show things that are nearby
